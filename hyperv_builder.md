## Bug - not handling user variables correctly in boot cmd

I have come across an odd issue. It seems that user variables in the boot string aren't being replaced correctly for the hyperv-iso builder. The files in this repo can reproduce the problem.

Initially it was stuck in GRUB as if the boot command was never being processed. Eventually I figured out that the part of the boot string that was supposed to drop to the GRUB command line was never entered. I rolled it into boot_cmd, and it got further.

As of this point, 
`packer.exe build -only=hyperv-iso -var-file=ubuntu1204.json ubuntu.json`

This will hang at the language chooser screen in the installer. 


I brought up `dmesg` on the second VT. It shows that user vars weren't handled correctly

## Note: Cannot get SSH IP address for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Ubuntu 12.04 doesn't have the updated Linux integration components by default. Getting the IP address of a running VM won't work.

```

Even once installation is complete, the IP address cannot be found


```none

```

[this thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33027204/how-can-i-get-hyper-v-to-detect-my-ubuntu-vms-ip-address) seems to show its a known issue resolved by running
`sudo apt-get install "linux-cloud-tools-$(uname -r)"`

I added this to Ubuntu.json, but it still fails for 12.04. It looks like the package was never added to that release.


## Bug: shutdown command fails

The VM is shut down as expected, but it triggers a failure. It's happening both with my changes to the boxcutter images, and also to [@taliesin's packer-basebox](https://github.com/taliesins/packer-baseboxes/blob/master/hyperv-ubuntu-16.04.json) .

This seems to be tracked at https://github.com/taliesins/packer-baseboxes/issues/2

## 4/8/2017 trying ubuntu1604.json with Packer v1.0.0


Note: prepend this with `cmd /c` if running from PowerShell

```
packer.exe build -only=hyperv-iso -var-file=ubuntu1604.json ubuntu.json
```

Still got stuck with kvp daemon failed. Had to stop & start VM then it proceeded
